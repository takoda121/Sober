# ⚠️ This version is missing dependencies
## Sober

Sober is a runtime for running Roblox on Linux.

## quick start

### notes

- you must recurse submodules when cloning the repository
- Clang is the only supported compiler, since Bionic uses a Clang-specific extension
- build dependencies:
  - git
  - ninja
  - meson
  - clang
- required libraries:
  - zlib
  - curl
  - egl
  - glesv2
  - vulkan
  - sdl2

### building

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/takoda121/Sober.git
$ cd sober
$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ meson setup build
$ meson compile -C build
```

### usage

grab a Roblox APK from a legitimate source (such as by extracting it from your phone yourself)

by default, sober expects the following directory structure:
- `lib/arm64-v8a/libroblox.so` from the APK in `~/.local/share/sober/libroblox.so`
- the contents of `assets/main.1.com.roblox.client.obb` in `~/.local/share/sober/assets`

once you're ready, just run the `sober` binary generated by the build process.
